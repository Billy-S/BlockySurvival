This is a list of raw unstructured ideas I have randomly

MAIN GOAL: how do I program a scenario? What is a scenario? etc
 
 0 is mainly function ideas/notes on how to execute things
 
 0.) Make functions less linear and have sub functions after the proof of concept is completed
 
 0.) only check nodes using voxelmanip when in new floored position
 
 0.) minetest.line_of_sight(pos1, pos2, stepsize) to check if a mob sees player
 
 0.) minetest.find_path(pos1,pos2,searchdistance,max_jump,max_drop,algorithm)
 0.) do pathfinding by setting yaw towards the next point in the table
 0.) only run this function if the goal entity/player is in a new node to prevent extreme lag
  
 0.) sneaking mobs, if a mob is sneaking, vs running at you, make no walking sounds
  
 0.) Make mobs define wether they float or sink in water
 
 0.) running particles
 
 0.) make mobs get hurt in nodes that deal player damage
 0.) make mobs slow down or bounce on nodes that do that to players 
 
 0.) Make mobs collision detection detect boats, minecarts, and other physical things, somehow, possibly just don't collide with
 0.) item entities
     
 0.) when mob gets below 0.1 velocity do set velocity to make it stand still ONCE so mobs don't float and set acceleration to 0
 
 0.) if mob stops moving and def.opens_doors = true and in door then open door to leave
    
 1.) lightweight ai that walks around, stands, does something like eat grass
 
 2.) make mobs drown if drown = true in definition
 
 3.) Make mobs avoid other mobs and players when walking around
  
 5.) attacking players
 
 7.) utility mobs
 
 8.) underwater and flying mobs
 
 9.) pet mobs
 
 10.) mobs climb ladders, and are affected by nodes like players are
 0.) if the pathfinding goal is unreachable then don't pathfind
 0.) else if pathfinding, try to find ladder in area if ladder = true in definition, then climb the ladder to the goal
 
 11.) have mobs with player mesh able to equip armor and wield an item with armor mod
 
 12.) Document each function with line number in release
 
 13.) Mobs that build structures
 
 14.) Traders
 14.) Traders can use stock gui or a 3d representation of a gui that shows the item physically in the world
 
 Or in other words, mobs that add fun and aesthetic to the game, yet do not take away performance
 
 This is my first "professional" level mod which I hope to complete
 
 This is a huge undertaking, I will sometimes take breaks, days in between to avoid rage quitting, but will try to
 make updates as frequently as possible
 
 Rolling release to make updates in minetest daily (git) to bring out the best in the engine
 
 I use tab because it's the easiest for me to follow in my editor, I apologize if this is not the same for you
 
 I am also not the best speller, feel free to call me out on spelling mistakes
